        "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of storing data in rows and columns as one would with a relational database, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB uses a format called BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.\n",
