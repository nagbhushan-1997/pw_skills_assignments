        "# Mutlithreading Assignment 2\n",
        "# Q1: What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
        "Answer: Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes independently, allowing for parallel execution of code. It is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks where the task execution time can be significantly reduced by spreading the load across multiple CPUs or cores. It avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that limits threads to one CPU core at a time, thereby exploiting multiple cores for concurrent execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2: What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
        "Answer: Multithreading involves multiple threads sharing the same memory space. It's beneficial for I/O-bound tasks but limited by the GIL in Python, which allows only one thread to execute at a time.\n",
        "Multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. It's beneficial for CPU-bound tasks and bypasses the GIL, allowing true parallel execution on multi-core systems.\n",

It simplifies the process of assigning tasks to multiple workers and collecting their results. It's used to manage a fixed number of workers, optimize resource usage, and simplify the code needed to parallelize tasks."
