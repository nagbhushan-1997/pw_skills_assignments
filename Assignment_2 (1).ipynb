    "In Python, you can add comments to your code to make it more readable and to provide explanations or clarifications. Comments are lines of code that are ignored by the Python interpreter and are intended for human readers. There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.\n",

    "In Python, variables are used to store data or values. A variable is essentially a named location in the computer's memory where you can store and retrieve data. You can assign a value to a variable, and that value can be of different types, such as numbers, strings, lists, or objects.\n",

For example, if you assign an integer value to a variable, Python will treat it as an integer type. Similarly, if you assign a string value, Python will treat it as a string type.\n",

    "You can also assign a new value to an existing variable, and Python will update the variable with the new value. For example:\n",
